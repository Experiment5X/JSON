JSON Parser
============

This is currently a work in progress, but when it's finished it will be a JSON library written in C++ capable of parsing JSON structures. The reason that I started this project was to become more familiar with compilers, so don't expect this to be an amazing library or anything. Json.org is where I learned the specifics of the format. It really was a great resource for understanding it. They have graphs on parsing the structures and tons of other documentation that is really awesome and helped me a ton with this project, so kudos to them.
