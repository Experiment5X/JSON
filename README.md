JSON Parser
============

This is a simple JSON library written in C++11 that will parse JSON structures. The reason that I started this project was to become more familiar with compilers, so don't expect this to be an amazing library or anything. http://json.org is where I learned the specifics of the format. It really was a great resource for understanding it. They have graphs on parsing the structures and tons of other documentation that is really awesome and helped me a ton with this project, so kudos to them.

If you want to know how to use this library, refer the main.cpp code file. There is an example in there with some comments and stuff, but really it's pretty easy to use.
